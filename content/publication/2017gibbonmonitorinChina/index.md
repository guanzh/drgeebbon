abstract: Population monitoring is important for the conservation of endangered wild animal species. Gibbons (Hylobatidae), a class â…  national key protected species, are the only apes distributed in China. Based on the current population monitoring and investigation of gibbon, we created the timeline of monitoring work and reviewed the development, duration time and protection effect on 4 gibbon species, analyzed the role of scientific research in the gibbon conservation projects, and put forward some concrete measures for future gibbon monitoring work.
