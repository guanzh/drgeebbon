abstract: Although many species are threatened by hunting or resource extraction from indigenous human communities, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of local communities has the potential to support management and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. TEK appears to limit poaching of gibbons, thus contributing to their survival. The persistence of gibbons outside nature reserves may depend on incorporating TEK within community-based conservation strategies.
