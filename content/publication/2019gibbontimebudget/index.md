abstract: Food abundance and climatic factors can significantly affect the behavior of animals and constrain their activity budgets. The population of western black crested gibbons (Nomascus concolor) in Mt. Wuliang lives in montane forest and is close to the northern extreme of the distribution for gibbons (Hylobatidae). Their habitats show remarkable seasonal variation in terms of food availability, temperature, and rainfall. To understand behavioral adaptations of western black crested gibbons to different sets of ecological conditions, we examined relationships among food availability, mean temperature, rainfall, and behavior patterns by observing two groups for 1 year each. Our results revealed that activity budget was affected by food availability and mean temperature. The gibbons spent more time eating flowers when that resource was more available and spent less time moving when fruit was more available. The gibbons spent less time feeding and more time resting, and spent less feeding time on fruit and leaves when the mean temperature was lower. These results suggest that the gibbons displayed a pronounced preference for flowers as a food resource and adopted a time minimizer strategy when high‐nutrient food items (i.e., fruit) were more available. In addition, the gibbons adopted an energy‐conserving strategy during periods of low temperature. The flexibility of behavioral patterns in responding to food availability and temperature may potentially improve the gibbons’ prospects of surviving and reproducing in a northern montane forest.

summary: This is the first detailed study of seasonal variation in activity budget and feeding behavior of western black crested gibbons. The gibbons displayed a pronounced preference for flowers as a food resource. The gibbons adopted a time minimizer strategy when high‐nutrient food items (i.e., fruit) were more available and an energy‐conserving strategy during periods of low temperature.
